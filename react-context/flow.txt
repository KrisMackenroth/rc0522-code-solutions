User can Sign Up:
If the user is signing up, they send a post request with the request
being their username and password. If the password and username are entered properly,
the password is then hashed, and then the username and hashed password are queried into
the database.

User can Sign In:
If the user is signing in, they send a post request with their username and password.
Once the username and password are properly inputed, the database is queried to determine
if that username exists. If it does, the password that was entered is verified to be matching
the hashed password that is within the database. If they match, a token for the user is created
to authorize that they are signed in.

The token that was given to the user is saved to localStoreage in order to ensure that the token stays with
them while they continue to remained signed in.

User can stay signed in (even if they refresh the page):
If the user signed in properly, the token they were given is saved to local storage.
If the page is reloaded, the page checks if there is a token that has been saved to local
storage. If there is a token saved to local storage, the token is decoded to determine who the user
currently is and keeps them logged in. If there is no token, the page reloads to the login and sign up page.



User can Sign Out:
When the user wishes to sign out, the token that was saved to local storage is removed and the
state of the user is set to null. If the user is null, the page switches to the login and sign up view.
